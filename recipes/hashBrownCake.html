      <p>These homemade hash brown patties are super crispy and insanely delicious. The perfect accompaniment to any breakfast style sandwich!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium sized White Potatoes, grated on a box grater (approx 7oz/200g EACH)</li>
            <li>1 Shallot, peeled & grated</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Butter
            </li>
            <li>1 tbsp Plain/All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Salt, Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <ol>
          <li>Add grated potato to a mixing bowl and pour in cold water. Swish around with your hands and squeeze the potato to help remove the starch.</li> 
          <li>Drain water and place potato shreds onto a cloth above a bowl. Add the grated shallot then wrap everything into a tight ball and squeeze out as much water as physically possible. Place potato/shallot into a clean/dry bowl.</li> 
          <li>Add 1 tbsp flour and 1/4 tsp salt and black pepper. Use a spatula to combine. At this point the salt will draw out a small amount of moisture from the potato, just enough to glue with the flour to stick the potato shreds together. Divide potato into 6 then form into patty shapes.</li> 
          <li>Heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add patties and fry for 3-5mins each side, or until golden and crispy. Enjoy!</li> 
          <li>Enjoy!!</li>
        </ol>
